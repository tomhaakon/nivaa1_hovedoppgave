# Mitt prosjekt - hovedoppgave 1

## Description

With this project I wanted to make an example of a homepage that could be used for a company or a personal business in a
modern design with CSS. Exploring transparency, bluring and placement of elements. Was very fun and challanging.
I started with a basic color scheme and worked from there.

This project made me learn so much, especially CSS to find how powerfull CSS really are. I want to dive more into the depths of CSS and also use the same workflow for later projects.

Made for laptop / desktop displays only, did not use much time to make it compitable for smaller screens such as mobile devices.
